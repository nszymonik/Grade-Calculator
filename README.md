# Grade Calculator
This program will enable students to be able to easily calculate their grade. They’ll be able to use common templates and edit them to suit the particular class upon creating the “class”, and once created, they can simply load the “class” that they earlier saved, and update it (And save it), at any time, and the program will notify the user what grade they need on everything remaining in order to get each letter grade. This is also something that the user will be able to customize, in that they can pick a particular thing, such as a final exam, and determine what’s needed on that, given the range of 0% to 100% on everything else.
